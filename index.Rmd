Hello, World!

Welcome to `college: refactored` a re-imagined take to college admissions guidance and preparation! We pride ourselves with providing a new-age, post-covid perspective to the college admissions process, while enabling students to stay genuine to themselves. We cater to students; they are at the helm of the ship of the rest of their lives, and they should have the opportunity to set a course and navigate their ship via decisions made, beginning foremost with college.
